                    This was a thrilling project where I led a 3-person team in implementing a novel score-based diffusion algorithm for generating images, based on a recent academic paper. Translating the complex mathematical concepts from the paper into functional code using PyTorch was quite the challenge, but incredibly rewarding. We authored comprehensive documentation throughout the project, ensuring clear communication and well-defined milestones. To our knowledge, no one had ever used this algorithm on images, and I'm really proud of the work we did.

                    Our results were below what we were hoping for, but the learning experience and the challenge of implementing a new algorithm from scratch were invaluable. Google Colab, where we ran our experiments, is not exactly friendly for 12+ hour coding sessions, but we managed to overcome the hurdles.
